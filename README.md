HieraPy
=======

Shy attempt at porting Puppet's [Hiera](https://github.com/puppetlabs/hiera) to Python as a coding excercise.

Shamelessly forked from [multiconfig](https://github.com/basementcat/multiconfig).

Main motivation: Be able to read certain config data from Puppet's Hiera into a Fabric deploy script.
